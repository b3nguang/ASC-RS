# ASC-RS

ASC-RS is a Rust rewrite of the command-line core of
[Droid ASC](https://github.com/MG1937/ASC). It opens `classes*.dex` entries
directly from an APK, parses DEX metadata without Python, locates classes, and
scans bytecode references to strings, types, methods, and fields.

Java source rendering defaults to Androguard's pure-Rust `dex-decompiler`,
which builds on its Rust `dex-parser` and `dex-bytecode` projects. Binary
Android manifests are decoded by Androguard's Rust `axml-parser`. This default
path has no Python, JVM, JADX, or other external runtime dependency. An optional
JADX CLI backend is available when higher-level Java reconstruction is more
important than startup latency.

`getclass` follows ASC's on-demand pipeline rather than decompiling the whole
DEX:

1. Read root DEX metadata from the mapped ZIP central directory, then probe
   compressed-size-ordered DEX files with a type-table binary search until the
   requested class is found.
2. Walk only that class's instructions and collect string/type/field/method
   dependencies.
3. Preserve its interfaces, annotations, static values, debug metadata, and
   try/catch handlers.
4. Canonically sort and deduplicate every referenced ID table, then rewrite all
   instruction and metadata operands.
5. Build and validate a one-class DEX in memory, including section layout,
   SHA-1 signature, and Adler-32 checksum.
6. Pass that small DEX to the selected built-in or JADX decompiler.

The parser primitives used by reference search and minimal-DEX extraction live
in one shared format layer. A reusable `AscSession` owns mapped APK metadata, a
bounded LRU DEX cache, successful class locations, and its worker pool. Cached
entries retain parsed metadata, method descriptors, and per-reference-kind
bytecode indexes; repeated GUI/service queries therefore avoid reinflating,
reparsing, and walking the same instructions. Concurrent requests for the same
entry share one load. The bytecode walker reads little-endian code units directly
from the DEX buffer instead of allocating a temporary instruction vector for
every method.
Physical DEX 041 containers are exposed and searched as separate logical DEX
files while their absolute offsets continue to address one shared buffer.

## Build

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

The executable is `target/release/asc-rs.exe` on Windows.

## Codex Skill

The repository includes a discoverable Codex skill at
`.agents/skills/asc-rs`. Launch Codex anywhere inside this repository and invoke
`$asc-rs`, or describe a focused APK decompilation, reference-search, or
manifest task and let Codex select it automatically. The layout follows the
[official OpenAI skill format](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/build-skills).

## Usage

```powershell
asc-rs getclass app.apk com.example.Main -o Main.java
asc-rs getclass --engine jadx app.apk com.example.Main -o Main.java
asc-rs getclass --engine jadx --jadx-path C:\tools\jadx\bin\jadx.bat app.apk com.example.Main
asc-rs findrefs app.apk string Authorization
asc-rs findrefs app.apk strings Authorization token api.example.com
asc-rs findrefs app.apk type com.example.Main
asc-rs findrefs app.apk method onCreate --class com.example.Main
asc-rs findrefs app.apk method notify --class openclaw --fuzzy-class
asc-rs findrefs app.apk field token --class com.example.Main
asc-rs manifest app.apk -o AndroidManifest.xml
asc-rs classes --contains MainActivity app.apk
asc-rs entries --contains assets/ app.apk
asc-rs entry --offset 1024 --length 64 --encoding hex app.apk assets/data.bin
asc-rs findrefs --format json app.apk string Authorization
```

Use `--debug` for per-DEX counts and timings, and `--threads N` to choose the
number of DEX inflation and search workers. `getclass` defaults to the in-process
pure-Rust `builtin` engine and its fast `simple` strategy. Use `--engine jadx`
for the external JADX CLI, which is usually slower to start but often produces
more readable Java. ASC-RS searches for JADX on `PATH`; `--jadx-path PATH` selects
an explicit executable or launcher. JADX defaults to `restructure`; both engines
accept explicit `-m restructure`, `-m simple`, and `-m fallback` overrides.

The `strings` form accepts one or more patterns and scans each DEX string table
once with a shared multi-pattern matcher. Its output stays grouped by query;
overlapping, repeated, and empty patterns have the same semantics as separate
`string` searches.

Reference results include complete Dalvik method and field signatures. The
library's structured results additionally retain the caller and target indexes
and the exact code-unit offset for navigation.

The `classes` command provides lightweight class discovery across all root DEX
files. `entries` inventories the APK without extracting it, while `entry` reads
an exact uncompressed byte range as a hex dump, UTF-8 text, or an output-only
raw file. Every command supports `--format json` except raw entry output;
`--debug` diagnostics continue to use stderr.

## Library API

Frontends can keep one session open and receive structured results:

```rust
use asc_rs::{
    apk::{list_entries, read_entry_range},
    dex::Query,
    service::{
        AscSession, DecompilationEngine, DecompilationMode, DecompileOptions,
    },
};

let session = AscSession::open("app.apk", 8)?;
let class = session.decompile_class(
    "com.example.Main",
    DecompilationMode::Simple,
)?;
let jadx_class = session.decompile_class_with_options(
    "com.example.Main",
    &DecompileOptions {
        engine: DecompilationEngine::Jadx,
        mode: DecompilationMode::Restructure,
        jadx_executable: None,
    },
)?;
let references = session.find_references(
    &Query::String("Authorization".to_owned()),
)?;
let batch = session.find_string_references_batch(&[
    "Authorization".to_owned(),
    "token".to_owned(),
])?;
let classes = session.apk().list_classes()?;
let entries = list_entries(std::path::Path::new("app.apk"))?;
let bytes = read_entry_range(
    std::path::Path::new("app.apk"),
    "assets/data.bin",
    1024,
    Some(64),
)?;
# Ok::<(), anyhow::Error>(())
```

`OperationObserver` provides thread-safe progress and cancellation callbacks.
The default session cache owns at most 512 MiB of decompressed DEX data; parsed
metadata and lazy indexes are evicted with their owning DEX. Use
`AscSession::open_with_cache_limit` to choose another bound, and
`ApkSession::clear_dex_cache` to explicitly release all cached entries.

See [`BENCHMARK.md`](BENCHMARK.md) for the speed and result-set comparison
against the original Python ASC on the supplied demo APK.
